    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an easy way to make Korean short ribs. You can also substitute chicken breast or sliced rib-eye for the short ribs. 
        If you use chicken or rib-eye, you must add thinly sliced green onion tops. This can also be broiled in the oven for the same amount of time.</p>

                <li>Submerge ribs in marinade; cover the bowl and refrigerate 7 to 12 hours -the longer, the better.</li>
