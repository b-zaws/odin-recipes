odin-recipes

This is a very simple html-only website with three Korean food recipes. Main point of this project is to show that I know how to use git, how to create a html files (boilerplate, tags).

It consists of an index page, and 3 recipe pages, each consisting an image, header and paragraph tags, and both ordered and unordered lists.

This project is a part of my take on The Odin Camp Foundations Course.
